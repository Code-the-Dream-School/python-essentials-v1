### **Lesson 13: Capstone Project — Assignment Review Guide**

### **Assignment Rubric**
You can mark the student's assignment as complete if they:
*   [ ] **Data Loading:** Successfully loaded the data using Pandas (`read_csv`, `read_json`, etc.).
*   [ ] **Data Cleaning:** Identified and handled duplicates, nulls, or incorrect data types.
*   [ ] **Documentation:** Included Markdown sections explaining the cleaning process and the logic behind their analysis.
*   [ ] **Feature Engineering:** Created at least **three** additional columns to derive insights.
*   [ ] **Aggregation:** Performed at least **three** aggregations (e.g., `groupby` or `sum`).
*   [ ] **Visualizations:** Created at least **three** high-quality plots with titles, labels, and legends.
*   [ ] **Insights:** Provided at least **three** clear conclusions supported by their charts and text.
*   [ ] **Mindset:** Answered the prompts regarding Imposter Syndrome.

### **What to Look For**
*   **Reproducibility:** Can you run the notebook from top to bottom without errors? Are all dependencies specified?.
*   **Cleaning Depth:** Did they just load the data, or did they actually address the "messy" parts (e.g., stripping whitespace, unifying abbreviations, or converting numeric strings to floats)?.
*   **Chart Strategic Choice:** Did they choose the right chart for the data? For example, using a scatter plot for correlations or a bar chart for categorical comparisons.
*   **Narrative Flow:** Does the notebook tell a story? The Markdown sections should guide the reader from the initial problem to the final conclusions.

### **Stretch Goals (Optional)**
*   [ ] Did the student use interactive visualizations like **Plotly** or **Dash**?.
*   [ ] Did the student identify and discuss potential **biases or limitations** in their dataset?.
